# ts-val-subagent

Validate the `agents/<skill-name>.md` file that corresponds to a given Task Skill.

## Task Purpose

Detect structural and quality issues in the subagent definition before the Task Skill is finalized, so that the agent and its child skill form a correct, self-contained pair.

## Input

Passed by the orchestrator:
- Task skill directory path (e.g., `~/.claude/skills/my-skill/`)
- Skill name derived from the directory (used to locate `agents/<name>.md`)

## Task-Specific Conditions

- Read files only — do NOT modify any files
- Use `../../docs/reference/claude/skills/task-subagent/skill-subagent-review-checklist.md` as the reference checklist
- The agent file is expected at `~/.claude/agents/<skill-name>.md`
- If the agent file does not exist, report ❌ immediately

## Output Format

```markdown
## Subagent Validation: <skill-name>
